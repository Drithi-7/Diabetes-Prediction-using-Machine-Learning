# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various medical attributes. It uses a machine learning model trained on a well-known dataset (e.g., the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset) to assist with early diagnosis and prevention.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python** – General-purpose programming language
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For developing and showcasing code
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
